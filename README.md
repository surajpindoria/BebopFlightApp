# Bebop Flight App

Trying to create a replacement flight app for the Parrot Bebop drone.

The FreeFlight 3 app that is supported by Parrot is good, but it has
its problems. Using this app, you can connect either a PS3 or Xbox 360
controller and use this to control your drone instead. This provides 
finer controls, but also lays the ground work for other apps to be
built around the flight app.

Using the sample appliction provided by Cylon.js:
